I\\'m unsure if I will like the book style of opening & closing-or that I will have to pack on both sides & close it like a book-BUT it seems well made. Love the Caribbean blue color that I chose. It does have secure straps to hold my packing cubes in place on one side AND the opposite side had a zipper covering to secure stuff in side of it (thin stuff like undies) & it will also hold my packing cubes in place as it travels to Hawaii next week. I am unsure how secure the handles are. I have a solid Samson cloth bag & those handles have held regardless of how much I stuffed into it-but I needed a 2nd bag that was within the 62\" linear airline rules-hope this works for me! I think if you don\\'t use packing cubes, it would be a harder style bag to use. I\\'ll update if I suffer any \"fails\" while on vacation.', 'Excellent luggage and the Caribbean Blue pop\\'s! I got the 24\" in Caribbean Blue. First I LOVE THE COLOR!!! Blue is my color! I am going for a weeks stay, to surprise my son for Xmas. I just started packing. The lock is an excellent feature! Especially with it being the holiday season. I had a some trouble changing the lock code to my own. I was having trouble with the 2nd step ,turn the locks toward the arrows until you hear the reset button click. It took a good amount of trys to get it to click. Eventually I got it. Having the 2 handles help alot! I have started packing. I love the mesh pockets and organization. I  packed so far gifts capris and shorts. I\\'m hoping all of it fit\\'s! Us woman packs a good amount! Lol 😊I\\'m going to update my review after my trip!', 'The perfect size- 21x14x9 The perfect size which is a tad smaller than average.

At first I thought it was too big and they wouldn\\'t allow me through with it, although there was no problems. The bag is a perfect size and CAN be used as cabin baggage for flights. The bag is very durable as well, mine was about 11kg (25lbs) and the handles and straps didn\\'t break. I have had bags in the past where the handles or straps would get damaged from these kinds of weights. The bag looks extremely elegant as well. A lot of reviews mentioned that the zip is \"low quality\" although this is not the case for me, the zips are excellent quality! If you are looking for an elegant looking bag that is relatively cheap and great quality, this is the bag you want! I\\'ve waited a while to review this bag so I could try it out on a plenty of trips. The bag is really well made and I\\'ve lugged it around as hand luggage on a number of flights with no issues. Feels really comfortable to carry when walking around and the handles make it easy to hold on trains etc. The bag holds loads and is really flexible.', \"They held up well I got these as a Black Friday deal so my view might be colored by the lower price I paid. Overall, these suitcases seem to be durable, even though they are lightweight. The large one has already endured an international trip with 2 layovers (so getting thrown around 3 times) with barely a scratch. The suitcases move nicely with the swivel wheels. The option to expand each is nice, and I like how lightweight they are so you can fit plenty in without going over weight limits. There is only a combination lock on the larger one so you'd need to buy a lock for the carry-on if you want that.Wonderful price!!!! I love how they nestle together. They are very well made, very sturdy and best of all they rotate and roll where you want them. Traveling here I come.\", \"The suitcase broke on first usage -- in the airport!!! I received this suitcase as a gift from my friends. The material didn't look to be very good, yet I thought it would be resistant. In the very first day I used it, the zipper burst, right in the airport, before I reached checkin line. I almost missed an international flight from San Francisco to Brazil because I wouldn't have been able to check a completely open bag. I had to run to the other terminal, and have it enveloped with plastic. It was a very stressful situation; had I not arrived very early in the airport, I would have lost a flight and probably spent hundreds of dollars on rescheduling it. Now I don't even know what to do with this bag as I am in Brazil and I assume that I won't be able to return it with free shipping. Be careful with this item!\", \"lOVE IT I have owned many suitcases. Coolife seems to be the only company that makes a product that can stand up the the abuse that airlines put luggage through.The fabric doesn't tear; the spinner wheels are a dream; extendable handles always glide like the day they were bought; zippers outlive other brands by years.I refuse to buy from anyone else now.\", 'Good luggage Good luggage. A little heavy so if you have 40 lb. weight limit you can only put 30 lbs. in it. But it held up well for 2 airline trips. 4 stars because of weight. Rolls great', 'Great Suitcase I just took this on a trip across the country on many flights.  It is a great bag!  Lots of space and the wheels roll nicely.  So nicely that my three year old son wanted to roll it himself all around the airport.  I will be buying him his own soon!  It also fits perfectly in the over head compartments of the airplane.  I highly recommend this suitcase and will be buying more myself.', 'Very Cheap - broke after first trip The luggage was able to hold quite a bit. However, after my first trip I found that the luggage fell apart very quick. I did not even overpack the suitcase and the zipper broke right before my trip home.', 'Great quality for the price For the price, I was very impressed.', 'Just what I hoped for Tough for a non-metal case', 'Great product!

I’m disappointed that I have to look for another suitcase and also go out of my way to return this one. Beware and check everything  cause you never know I wouldn’t give any stars but you have to to add a review🤬', 'Five Stars The best, beautiful', 'Is there any way I can get a replacement ?

It cost too much to return. It's cheap for reason. I threw it away in the trash. Don't spend your money\", 'Meet all expectations Meet all expectations, very nice handling and size', 'Four Stars Luggage is NOT expandable...... wtf? False advertising', \"Nice quality and good color I was a little skeptical at first because of the price, but this was well worth it, if you're traveling light. Survived a flight with United Airlines and Southwest across the country as a carry on and as a checked luggage. I didn't notice any damages on it after getting my luggage back, which was a plus. You could easily fit at least 5 outfits in this thing + bathroom necessities.If you open the suitcase, the suitcase is a little bumpy on the inside, as it doesn't have a hard lining over bottom part of the suitcase, but this allows you put more things in between the cracks. The top port of the suitcase has a zipper, which was a huge plus in holding my bathroom necessities in place. Handles worked fine. Suitcase wasn't damaged during the flight. Nice color. Did the job, Overall would definitely recommend buying, if you're considering this suitcase. This is probably going to go everywhere with me whenever I travel!\", \"Sturdy and reliable Perfect size carry on suitcase. This suitcase is perfect. I got this for my daughter which travels a lot with the Beta club at school. It's perfect size for packing for a weekend. I got this in Grey color. It's a nice hard suitcase that features 4 wheels and a rolling handle. The case has reinforced corners to prevent damage. The case is hard but does have some give that can take quite a bit of bumps and thumps. The case itself is quite light. Inside there is a luggage strap to hold your things tight and prevent things from unfolding during travel. It also features a mesh compartment at the top. The mesh area is great for putting your worn clothes so it doesn't mix with your other things, and so you don't have to carry an extra bag to keep it separate. You can use this area for other things as well like possibly delicates, underwear, or socks. The easy to grab security zipper glides nicely around the case, with an area to easily place a luggage lock. The case has an expanding zipper area also, you can unzip this to give you a bit more room. I definitely recommend this case. It's the perfect travel size.\"]\n",

I have had bags in the past where the handles or straps would get damaged from these kinds of weights. The bag looks extremely elegant as well. A lot of reviews mentioned that the zip is \"low quality\" although this is not the case for me, the zips are excellent quality! If you are looking for an elegant looking bag that is relatively cheap and great quality, this is the bag you want! I've waited a while to review this bag so I could try it out on a plenty of trips. The bag is really well made and I've lugged it around as hand luggage on a number of flights with no issues. Feels really comfortable to carry when walking around and the handles make it easy to hold on trains etc. The bag holds loads and is really flexible.\n",

      "Title + Cont = They held up well I got these as a Black Friday deal so my view might be colored by the lower price I paid. Overall, these suitcases seem to be durable, even though they are lightweight. The large one has already endured an international trip with 2 layovers (so getting thrown around 3 times) with barely a scratch. The suitcases move nicely with the swivel wheels. The option to expand each is nice, and I like how lightweight they are so you can fit plenty in without going over weight limits. There is only a combination lock on the larger one so you'd need to buy a lock for the carry-on if you want that.Wonderful price!!!! I love how they nestle together. They are very well made, very sturdy and best of all they rotate and roll where you want them. Traveling here I come.\n",

      "Title + Cont = The suitcase broke on first usage -- in the airport!!! I received this suitcase as a gift from my friends. The material didn't look to be very good, yet I thought it would be resistant. In the very first day I used it, the zipper burst, right in the airport, before I reached checkin line. I almost missed an international flight from San Francisco to Brazil because I wouldn't have been able to check a completely open bag. I had to run to the other terminal, and have it enveloped with plastic. It was a very stressful situation; had I not arrived very early in the airport, I would have lost a flight and probably spent hundreds of dollars on rescheduling it. Now I don't even know what to do with this bag as I am in Brazil and I assume that I won't be able to return it with free shipping. Be careful with this item!\n",

So nicely that my three year old son wanted to roll it himself all around the airport.  I will be buying him his own soon!  It also fits perfectly in the over head compartments of the airplane.  I highly recommend this suitcase and will be buying more myself.\n",

Survived a flight with United Airlines and Southwest across the country as a carry on and as a checked luggage. I didn't notice any damages on it after getting my luggage back, which was a plus. You could easily fit at least 5 outfits in this thing + bathroom necessities.If you open the suitcase, the suitcase is a little bumpy on the inside, as it doesn't have a hard lining over bottom part of the suitcase, but this allows you put more things in between the cracks. The top port of the suitcase has a zipper, which was a huge plus in holding my bathroom necessities in place. Handles worked fine. Suitcase wasn't damaged during the flight. Nice color. Did the job, Overall would definitely recommend buying, if you're considering this suitcase. This is probably going to go everywhere with me whenever I travel!\n",

      "Title + Cont = Sturdy and reliable Perfect size carry on suitcase. This suitcase is perfect. I got this for my daughter which travels a lot with the Beta club at school. It's perfect size for packing for a weekend. I got this in Grey color. It's a nice hard suitcase that features 4 wheels and a rolling handle. The case has reinforced corners to prevent damage. The case is hard but does have some give that can take quite a bit of bumps and thumps. The case itself is quite light. Inside there is a luggage strap to hold your things tight and prevent things from unfolding during travel. It also features a mesh compartment at the top. The mesh area is great for putting your worn clothes so it doesn't mix with your other things, and so you don't have to carry an extra bag to keep it separate. You can use this area for other things as well like possibly delicates, underwear, or socks. The easy to grab security zipper glides nicely around the case, with an area to easily place a luggage lock. The case has an expanding zipper area also, you can unzip this to give you a bit more room. I definitely recommend this case. It's the perfect travel size.\n",
