"Not as advertised Loved the color, but will be sending back.  Its advertised as ""expandable"", but not so.  Seems very sturdy and roomy.  Would keep for sure if expandable."
"The ability to roll the luggage without tilting was a nice benefit. The hard case was nice for those ... These worked out perfectly as carry-ons for our recent travels abroad. It held a decent amount of clothing, toiletries, etc. The ability to roll the luggage without tilting was a nice benefit. The hard case was nice for those rainy moments of travel between hotels. The locking system on the suitcase was perfect for adding more security. The only reason this is not receiving a 5 star review is that the zipper at times would feel a little catchy rather than fluid."
"Seems like a nice suitcase I've never had a hard case suitcase. I'm unsure if I will like the book style of opening & closing-or that I will have to pack on both sides & close it like a book-BUT it seems well made. Love the Caribbean blue color that I chose. It does have secure straps to hold my packing cubes in place on one side AND the opposite side had a zipper covering to secure stuff in side of it (thin stuff like undies) & it will also hold my packing cubes in place as it travels to Hawaii next week. I am unsure how secure the handles are. I have a solid Samson cloth bag & those handles have held regardless of how much I stuffed into it-but I needed a 2nd bag that was within the 62"" linear airline rules-hope this works for me! I think if you don't use packing cubes, it would be a harder style bag to use. I'll update if I suffer any ""fails"" while on vacation."
"The perfect size- 21x14x9 The perfect size which is a tad smaller than average.  Looks cool, a little glossy and has side handle.  All the features you need.  The TSA lock is not totally needed because you will carry this on.  Some product variability.  One of my wheels had a slight wobble, but the other did not.  In comparison, the Samsonite Omni PC is deeper at 9.5 and expandable, but may not conform and has no side handle.  That said, aside for some sample variability, a sleek, very cool (very Away looking) case.  The Samsonite Omni PC, this Coolife, and the Kenneth Cole are all very much similar and well liked because they work."
"Coolife luggage Not a bad piece. It’s maybe not as solid and study as I would like, but it looks great, can take a beating. (I don’t know how long) I have taken it on a few business trips and what I really like about it is the way the inside is laid out, the little locks ect...I would recommend it. It would have 5 stars if it felt like it was a bit more crush proof. Otherwise, I’m happy."
"28” luggage works great I’ve bought this item twice now, one for my wife; this one for me. Can’t say enough about it.Just completed a cruise with airfare to and from cruise ship to include plane transfers going and coming. A couple of scratches and scuffs. Very pleased."
Better performance than expected for $ Seemed a little delicate when I got it - but it’s survived 4 international fights and been tossed about in taxis in jeepnies and tuk-tuks and still looks (almost) like new. Surprised.
Solid suitcase Solid suitcase for the price. Like the built-in TSA locks.
Awesome quality for the price! The suitcase itself is very sleek and true to the color I originally ordered. The locking mechanism is a great incentive for those who like to go the extra step on securing their luggage. The overall feel of the suitcase is very hefty YET light. The 21” is still a pretty big suitcase for a weekend trip.
"IT NOT Let You Down..., Purchased this bag to use as cabin baggage for the flight. At first I thought it was too big and they wouldn't allow me through with it, although there was no problems. The bag is a perfect size and CAN be used as cabin baggage for flights. The bag is very durable as well, mine was about 11kg (25lbs) and the handles and straps didn't break. I have had bags in the past where the handles or straps would get damaged from these kinds of weights. The bag looks extremely elegant as well. A lot of reviews mentioned that the zip is ""low quality"" although this is not the case for me, the zips are excellent quality! If you are looking for an elegant looking bag that is relatively cheap and great quality, this is the bag you want! I've waited a while to review this bag so I could try it out on a plenty of trips. The bag is really well made and I've lugged it around as hand luggage on a number of flights with no issues. Feels really comfortable to carry when walking around and the handles make it easy to hold on trains etc. The bag holds loads and is really flexible."
"They held up well I got these as a Black Friday deal so my view might be colored by the lower price I paid. Overall, these suitcases seem to be durable, even though they are lightweight. The large one has already endured an international trip with 2 layovers (so getting thrown around 3 times) with barely a scratch. The suitcases move nicely with the swivel wheels. The option to expand each is nice, and I like how lightweight they are so you can fit plenty in without going over weight limits. There is only a combination lock on the larger one so you'd need to buy a lock for the carry-on if you want that.Wonderful price!!!! I love how they nestle together. They are very well made, very sturdy and best of all they rotate and roll where you want them. Traveling here I come."
"The suitcase broke on first usage -- in the airport!!! I received this suitcase as a gift from my friends. The material didn't look to be very good, yet I thought it would be resistant. In the very first day I used it, the zipper burst, right in the airport, before I reached checkin line. I almost missed an international flight from San Francisco to Brazil because I wouldn't have been able to check a completely open bag. I had to run to the other terminal, and have it enveloped with plastic. It was a very stressful situation; had I not arrived very early in the airport, I would have lost a flight and probably spent hundreds of dollars on rescheduling it. Now I don't even know what to do with this bag as I am in Brazil and I assume that I won't be able to return it with free shipping. Be careful with this item!"
lOVE IT I have owned many suitcases. Coolife seems to be the only company that makes a product that can stand up the the abuse that airlines put luggage through.The fabric doesn't tear; the spinner wheels are a dream; extendable handles always glide like the day they were bought; zippers outlive other brands by years.I refuse to buy from anyone else now.
Good luggage Good luggage. A little heavy so if you have 40 lb. weight limit you can only put 30 lbs. in it. But it held up well for 2 airline trips. 4 stars because of weight. Rolls great
Great Suitcase I just took this on a trip across the country on many flights.  It is a great bag!  Lots of space and the wheels roll nicely.  So nicely that my three year old son wanted to roll it himself all around the airport.  I will be buying him his own soon!  It also fits perfectly in the over head compartments of the airplane.  I highly recommend this suitcase and will be buying more myself.
"Very Cheap - broke after first trip The luggage was able to hold quite a bit. However, after my first trip I found that the luggage fell apart very quick. I did not even overpack the suitcase and the zipper broke right before my trip home."
"Great quality for the price For the price, I was very impressed."
Just what I hoped for Tough for a non-metal case
Great product! For the $$ Really nice luggage. Enough space and it is not heavyweight at all. Really love the 360 spin too!
Carry On Worthy Looks great
"Four Stars Cool color, durable, and I liked that it is expandable very good quality to have."

Enjoying life Traveling
Five Stars Love this suitcase!!
"Five Stars The best, beautiful"
Is there any way I can get a replacement ? The Airline bashed the corner of my suitcase on the trip home from England.
Zipper broke first time The zipper broke the first time I traveled with it! It cost too much to return. It's cheap for reason. I threw it away in the trash. Don't spend your money
"Meet all expectations Meet all expectations, very nice handling and size"
Four Stars Luggage is NOT expandable...... wtf? False advertising
"Nice quality and good color I was a little skeptical at first because of the price, but this was well worth it, if you're traveling light. Survived a flight with United Airlines and Southwest across the country as a carry on and as a checked luggage. I didn't notice any damages on it after getting my luggage back, which was a plus. You could easily fit at least 5 outfits in this thing + bathroom necessities.If you open the suitcase, the suitcase is a little bumpy on the inside, as it doesn't have a hard lining over bottom part of the suitcase, but this allows you put more things in between the cracks. The top port of the suitcase has a zipper, which was a huge plus in holding my bathroom necessities in place. Handles worked fine. Suitcase wasn't damaged during the flight. Nice color. Did the job, Overall would definitely recommend buying, if you're considering this suitcase. This is probably going to go everywhere with me whenever I travel!"
"Sturdy and reliable Perfect size carry on suitcase. This suitcase is perfect. I got this for my daughter which travels a lot with the Beta club at school. It's perfect size for packing for a weekend. I got this in Grey color. It's a nice hard suitcase that features 4 wheels and a rolling handle. The case has reinforced corners to prevent damage. The case is hard but does have some give that can take quite a bit of bumps and thumps. The case itself is quite light. Inside there is a luggage strap to hold your things tight and prevent things from unfolding during travel. It also features a mesh compartment at the top. The mesh area is great for putting your worn clothes so it doesn't mix with your other things, and so you don't have to carry an extra bag to keep it separate. You can use this area for other things as well like possibly delicates, underwear, or socks. The easy to grab security zipper glides nicely around the case, with an area to easily place a luggage lock. The case has an expanding zipper area also, you can unzip this to give you a bit more room. I definitely recommend this case. It's the perfect travel size."
